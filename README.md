# Mandelbrot
Software to see Mandelbrot and Julia fractals.
## Controls
Move the mouse to see the Julia fractal associated with the point the mouse points to.  
You can zoom in and out with the wheel and the up and down arrows. You can left click and move to explore the Mandelbrot fractal.
## Animation
If the mouse pointer is not over the Mandelbrot fractal window, a simulated pointer moves in circle and you can see Julia fractal animating.
